    """
    Given the outputs of a LSTM, get the last relevant output that
    is not padding. We assume that the last 2 dimensions of the input
    represent (sequence_length, hidden_size).

    Parameters
    ----------
    output: Tensor
        A tensor, generally the output of a tensorflow RNN.
        The tensor index sequence_lengths+1 is selected for each
        instance in the output.

    sequence_length: Tensor
        A tensor of dimension (batch_size, ) indicating the length
        of the sequences before padding was applied.

    Returns
    -------
    last_relevant_output: Tensor
        The last relevant output (last element of the sequence), as retrieved
        by the output Tensor and indicated by the sequence_length Tensor.
